御坂註冊這個域名還沒發過 genderqueer 相關的東西，今天發一篇習作吧。
御坂御坂感覺英語期末要掛道。

You wore a Mackintosh. Yes, I see.

It is your armour. An armour, heavy and solid enough, can keep you safe yet also overwhelm you.
Yes, the world is too dangerous to let people expose their authentic emotion to, thus everyone does need to protect herself throughout all her life. As a proud member of LGBTQQIAA, you may be laughed when you behave, be depressed when you act, be condemned, if not persecuted, when you bravely come out of the closet. Even other LGBTQQIAAs might also criticize you in a very unfair way. It is never tolerated by human society who does not follow the standards and the guidelines.
Then you started closing your heart. You deny your feeling, you fake yourself - not the physical human being but you, the person decided by what you want, what you think and what you love. If I were writing a passage of chicken soup for the soul, I would make a criticism of the above in order to show my "healthy mentality". I just won't make a piece of big news. Instead, I will treat the denying and the mask as a tool used to defend your unique and unchangeable life. Who can defy the whole nation of cisgender and heterosexual tradition? Criticism is powerless in front of the social incapability.
Justifiable defense with a mental armour isn't and will never be a crime.

However, hiding in the closet cannot be a permanent escapement, not to say a solution.
A person without acceptance of emotion is a zombie with perception of pain. I don't know whether gender identity and sexual orientation are immutable, but I deeply understand that they are undeniable. You can hide yourself in a period of time, but you cannot live a free life with the mask of sensory deprivation.
In your whole life, you have to listen to, you have to face with, you have to accept yourself after all; in a larger sense, we cannot survive, we cannot forget, we cannot stand alone in a world fulfilled with terror and discrimination.
We are really lucky living in a community without death penalty due to sex identity, but it is still an imperfect world lacking in respect for differences.
Increasing popularity of non-straight jokes played by heterosexuals does not mean real LGBTQQIAA-friendly, since these are not based on friendliness but oddity. To promote the civilization progress, we have to stand out and make the change. We needn't die a martyr; in contrast, we do need to live a proud and unyielding life. Without self-awareness, no one would like to care about you; without self-esteem, no one will respect you. We won't be angry, since they want to prove that we are mad. Their behaviour will tell the truth that who are more ignorant than madmen.

The best defense is a good offense. In the face of hatred, love is more powerful than any armour or firewall. More than morality we need consciences, more than excitement we need critical-thinking, more than allegiance to the system we need devotion to our love. Regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity, may love trump hate.

And, Misaka Misaka writes sincerely.
